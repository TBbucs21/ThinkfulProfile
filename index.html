        <p>My name is Jake Thompson and I am a software developer living in Denver, Colorado.</p>
        <p>As well as being a music producer, I'm also interested in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Web designs and app designs that stand out and look clean.</li>
          <li>Quality code that just feels and looks right.</li>
          <li>Thinking and collaborating with like-minded developers to accomplish anything.</li>

      <!-- About -->
      <section>
        <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>

        <p>Throughout college I was always developing. But after graduation is when I really grew to love programming web and mobile apps. I have multiple side/personal projects that I enjoy a ton. I have also made a couple websites for clients and their businesses.</p>

        <p>As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier!</a>

        <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for a partner for a hackathon) please reach out! I am so excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
